# Genetic Programming for Julia

This is the code written by Morgan R. Frank for the paper [Genetic Programming for Julia: fast performance and parallel island model implementation](http://courses.csail.mit.edu/18.337/2015/projects/MorganFrank/projectReport.pdf) (2015).

The original code was written for Julia circa 0.5 and has been updated here to work with Julia 1.4 (and possibly Julia 1.0+ but this is untested). The original code can be viewed in the first commit on this repository.

Currently only the single thread/single island code is working.

To make it run: `julia testSerialGP.jl`
